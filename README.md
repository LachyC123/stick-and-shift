## 🌐 Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Automatic Deployment

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch.

1. Go to your repository **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Under "Build and deployment", select **GitHub Actions** as the source
3. Push to `main` and the workflow will build and deploy automatically

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# The dist/ folder contains the production build
# Deploy this folder to your hosting provider
```

### Configuration

The `vite.config.ts` automatically sets the correct base path for GitHub Pages when `GITHUB_PAGES=true` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` environment variables are set.

**If your repository is named something other than `stick-and-shift`:**

1. Update `vite.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const repoName = process.env.REPO_NAME || 'your-repo-name';
   ```

2. Update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
   ```yaml
   env:
     GITHUB_PAGES: 'true'
     REPO_NAME: 'your-repo-name'
   ```

## 🎨 Adding New Content

### Adding New Characters

Edit `src/data/characters.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 'newCharacter',
  name: 'New Character',
  role: 'midfielder',
  description: 'Description here',
  stats: { speed: 6, stamina: 6, control: 6, shotPower: 6, passPower: 6, tackle: 6, dodge: 6 },
  trait: { name: 'Trait Name', description: 'What it does', effect: 'effectId' },
  downside: { name: 'Downside Name', description: 'The catch', effect: 'effectId' },
  unlockCost: 200,  // 0 for starter characters
  color: 0x3498db   // Hex color
}
```

### Adding New Upgrades

Edit `src/data/upgrades.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 'newUpgrade',
  name: 'New Upgrade',
  description: 'What it does',
  rarity: 'rare',  // common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary
  synergies: ['speedster', 'trickster'],  // Synergy tags
  hooks: ['onShot', 'onTick'],  // When effects trigger
  modifiers: [{ stat: 'speed', value: 10, isPercent: true }],
  effectId: 'customEffect',
  icon: '⚡',
  maxStacks: 1  // How many times it can be picked
}
```

Then add the effect handler in `src/systems/UpgradeSystem.ts` in the `effectCallbacks` object.

### Adding New Challenges

Edit `src/data/challenges.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 'newChallenge',
  name: 'Challenge Name',
  description: 'What to do',
  requirement: { type: 'goals', count: 50 },
  reward: { gems: 200, unlockCharacter: 'characterId' },
  tier: 2,
  icon: '🎯'
}
```

## 📋 CHANGELOG

### v1.3.0 - Gameplay Impact & AI Challenge Update

#### A) Impactful Tackles
- Added tackle impact constants: `TACKLE_KNOCKBACK=340`, `TACKLE_KNOCKBACK_CARRIER=480`
- Knockback pushes tackled players away from the tackler
- `TACKLE_STUN_MS=220` stun duration on successful tackle
- `TACKLE_HITSTOP_MS=55` micro-freeze for satisfying impact feel
- Ball pops loose with strong impulse (`TACKLE_BALL_POP=420`) away from tackler
- Spark particle burst at contact point for visual feedback
- White flash on tackled player for added impact

#### B) Faster Pass & Shot
- Increased `PASS_SPEED_BASE` to 950 and `PASS_SPEED_MAX` to 1400
- Increased `SHOT_SPEED_BASE` to 1200 and `SHOT_SPEED_MAX` to 1750
- Reduced ball drag (`BALL_DRAG=0.990`) for faster travel
- `BALL_MAX_SPEED` raised to 1850 to support powerful shots
- Camera nudge on pass for subtle feedback

#### C) Charged Shot System
- Hold SPACE or mouse button to charge, release to fire
- `CHARGE_MIN_MS=80`, `CHARGE_MAX_MS=850` for timing window
- `CHARGE_POWER_MULT_MAX=1.35` power boost at full charge
- Visual charge bar above player while charging
- Stronger camera shake for charged shots
- Charge canceled on stun or possession loss

#### D) Smarter AI with Objective Awareness
- `ObjectiveDescriptor` passed from MomentSystem to AISystem
- AI adjusts aggression based on objective type (force_turnovers = high press)
- Dynamic line of engagement pushes higher when urgent
- Primary presser assigned to close down ball carrier
- Secondary presser covers passing lanes
- Defenders block shot lines when not actively pressing
- Contains behavior: presser approaches from goal-side to force wide
- Tackle angle check prevents unrealistic tackles from behind
- Difficulty scaling increases with moment number (+5% per moment)

#### E) Debug Display Toggle
- Press `F1` to toggle debug overlay
- Shows: possession state, objective type, urgency %, time remaining
- Displays player charging state and ball speed
- Useful for verifying AI behavior and game state

#### F) Code Quality
- `sparkBurst()` particle effect for tackle impacts
- `applyKnockback()` and `applyHitstop()` methods on Player
- Cleaner separation of objective logic in MomentSystem
- Type-safe objective descriptor interface

---

### v1.4.0 - Team Passing System

#### A) AI Passing to Teammates + Player
- Comprehensive `findBestPassTarget()` with scoring: lane clearness, forward progress, receiver openness, distance
- AI carrier brain evaluates PASS / SHOOT / DRIBBLE every 200ms
- Passes triggered when pressured, teammate in better position, or objective encourages possession
- Player calling bonus: teammates prioritize passing to player when R is pressed
- Pass cooldown (`AI_CARRIER_PASS_COOLDOWN=650ms`) prevents spam

#### B) Call for Pass Input
- Press R to call for pass (sets `isCallingForPass` for 1.2s)
- Visible "CALLING!" indicator above player in debug mode
- Teammates add +35 bonus score when considering player as pass target
- Works even without calling if player is open in a good lane

#### C) Off-Ball Support Movement
- Forward: makes runs into space ahead of ball
- Midfielder: triangle support positions for passing angles
- Defender: stays behind ball as safety outlet
- `applyTeammateSeparation()` prevents clustering
- Dynamic positioning based on ball carrier location

#### D) Enemy Team Passing
- Enemy AI uses same carrier brain logic
- Passes under pressure, switches play when blocked
- `getEnemyDangerScore()` evaluates who is in best position
- Creates realistic team play patterns

#### E) Receive Assist
- `ball.pass()` now tracks intended receiver
- Ball curves slightly toward receiver within `PASS_RECEIVE_RADIUS=60px`
- `PASS_NO_RECAPTURE_MS=120ms` window prevents instant stick-back to passer
- `canBePickedUpBy()` check in all ball pickup handlers

#### F) Debug Visualization
- F1 shows pass completion, calling state
- Green arrow line drawn when pass is made (debug mode)
- "CALLING!" text above player when requesting pass
- Pass lane visualization for debugging

#### G) New Tuning Constants
- `PASS_WEIGHT_LANE=30`, `PASS_WEIGHT_PROGRESS=20`, `PASS_WEIGHT_SPACE=25`
- `PASS_PLAYER_CALL_BONUS=35` for player priority
- `PASS_SCORE_THRESHOLD=20` minimum for valid pass
- `SUPPORT_TRIANGLE_OFFSET=100`, `SUPPORT_MIN_SEPARATION=70`

- `PASS_SPEED_BASE=720`, `SHOT_SPEED_BASE=980` for snappy ball movement
- Ball drag reduced (`BALL_DRAG=0.988`) so shots/passes travel properly
- `ball.kick()` unified method for all ball propulsion
- Visual pass line effect for feedback
- Camera shake on shots and tackles

#### B) Goal Detection (Reliable Scoring)
- Goal sensors now cover full goal mouth with depth behind line
- `ball.crossedLine()` tracks previous position for fast ball crossing detection
- `GOAL_COOLDOWN` prevents double-scoring
- Ball is immediately moved to safe position on goal
- Press `G` to toggle debug view of goal sensor rectangles
- Goals always register if ball enters goal mouth area

#### C) Smarter AI (No More Huddling)
- Lane blocking detection with `AI_LANE_WIDTH` for smarter passing decisions
- Dribble target finding avoids enemies and moves toward goal
- Chaser hysteresis prevents constant switching of ball chaser
- Decision rate-limiting (`AI_DECISION_INTERVAL=220ms`) for consistent behavior
- Tackle backoff prevents spam after failed tackles
- Formation positions adjust based on ball position

#### D) Upgrade Proc Feedback
- `procUpgrade(id, intensity)` method for tracking and showing feedback
- Upgrade icons pulse with rarity-colored glow when they activate
- Toast notification appears for high-intensity procs
- Proc counts tracked per moment for summary
- `getTopProcs(limit)` returns most-used upgrades

#### E) Code Quality
- All tuning constants in one file for easy balancing
- Consistent use of tuning constants across Player, Ball, AI
- TypeScript strict mode compatible
